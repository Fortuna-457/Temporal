<h2>Overview of the project</h2>
Our project integrates a historical blog with an interactive gaming experience, delivering both educational content and entertainment to users. The blog presents articles and discussions on various historical subjects, including aspects of the game, while the game offers two modes which are the quiz and the map exploration to delve into history. By blending these components seamlessly, we strive to create an engaging platform where users can dynamically and entertainingly learn about, play with, and interact with history.
